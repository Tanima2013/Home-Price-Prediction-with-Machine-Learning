Home Price Prediction using Linear Regression
<br>
This real estate price prediction project focuses on developing a model to accurately forecast home prices in Bangalore. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, undergoes thorough preprocessing, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and outlier detection. Key features like location, total square feet area, and number of bedrooms are utilized to train a Linear Regression model. After splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, the model achieves an accuracy score of approximately 86% on the test data. Cross-validation using K-Fold technique confirms the model's reliability and robustness, consistently showing accuracy scores above 80%. Overall, this project illustrates a comprehensive approach to building a real estate price prediction model, offering valuable insights for stakeholders in the Bangalore housing market.
